First of all I will tell you that C is a high level language, which developed by Dennis Ritchie, in 1972, in AT and T's bell laboratory California

                                            Now I will tell you about levels of language----->> 
6
                  We generally have two level of language-->
7
                                        LOW LAVEL            and       HIGH LAVEL 
8
A low level language->
9
                       To code in a low level language we have a good knowledge of hardwares because it is a Machine dependendent language.without a knowledge of hardware we coud't use a low level language.
10
High level language->
11
                      High level language is that language which does not depend on any hardware or we can say that a user does not need any knowledge of hardware because a high level language is developed that any user can use that without any knowledge of hardware I hope you understand what would I want to say by using these words

​
13
That's the different thing that a low level language is easily understood by computer or we can say the machine but a high level language is easily understand by us that is why all the language which are consider in programming are in high level.

15
Now I will tell you something about some word which are already fixed for some purpose are known as keyword we have 32 keywords in C.

Now I will tell you a lot talking about the characters of c 
26
​
27
Alphabets   A,B,C ......Z   or a, b, c........z 
28
Digits      .....-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2-1,0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,...... 
29
Symbols   !  @  #  % ^  &  * ()  _  +  -  =  ;  :  '   "  .......

31
NOTE:-> 
32
we can we can use any kind of symbol in C language except with Dollar sign ($) this sign is not Allow in C language.
33
​
34
Now I will tell you where we can write C program--> 
35
​
36
I advise you to use code block either in Windows and Linux turbo C also used as compiler in which we can write our c program. But if you are using Linux then builder in the best choice or we can say a best platform to write your program in Linux we use  a command gcc name of programc.c   and a command  ./a.out to run our program.
